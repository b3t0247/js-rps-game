Note: A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.

Todo:

#1 - Write a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’, and test it with console.log. 

#2 - Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
